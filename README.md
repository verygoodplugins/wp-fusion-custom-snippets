## üöÄ Quick Start

Get up and running in minutes:

1. **Have WP Fusion installed** ([Get it here](https://wpfusion.com/pricing/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=custom-snippets) or start with [WP Fusion Lite](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-fusion-lite/))
2. **Browse our [snippet categories](#-snippet-categories)** to find what you need
3. **Choose an [installation method](#-installation-methods)** that fits your workflow
4. **Copy, customize, and deploy** - Each snippet includes detailed documentation

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation Methods

Three ways to add these snippets to your site - choose what works best for you:

### Method 1: functions.php File

**Best for:** Quick testing, simple customizations

Add snippets directly to your theme's `functions.php`:

```php
// Add to your theme's functions.php (preferably in a child theme)
add_action( 'wpf_tags_modified', 'my_custom_function', 10, 2 );
function my_custom_function( $user_id, $tags ) {
    // Your custom logic here
}
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Pro tip:** Always use a child theme to preserve customizations during updates

### Method 2: Custom Plugin

**Best for:** Production sites, version control, portability

Create a custom plugin for your snippets:

```php
<?php
/**
 * Plugin Name: WP Fusion Custom Extensions
 * Description: Custom functionality extending WP Fusion
 * Version: 1.0.0
 * Author: Your Name
 */

// Prevent direct access
if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) {
    exit;
}

// Your custom snippets here
```

Save as `/wp-content/plugins/wpf-custom/wpf-custom.php` and activate

### Method 3: FluentSnippets Plugin

**Best for:** Non-developers, conditional logic, easy management

1. Install [FluentSnippets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-code-manager/)
